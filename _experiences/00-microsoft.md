  I interned at Microsoft CRM's Data Services team. I worked on a P0 feature to make a new scalable file storage and make files a first-class entity for other features.
</p>
<p>
  This P0 feature was kicked off by interns who owned everything from system design, to user experience, security, to deployment. I worked on the actual storage micro-services, handling the organization lifecycle, caching, and securing critical assets. This allowed us to deliver a satisfying, fast experience while meeting strict security and performance standards.

  During my time at Microsoft I worked with different Azure technologies such as Key Vault and RDB, as well as Reliable Actors and Services on Azure Service Fabric.
