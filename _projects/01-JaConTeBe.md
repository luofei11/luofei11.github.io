The JaConTeBe concurrency subject is a collection of 47 Java test classes that exhibit concurrency faults that are manifest within standard Java library classes and third-party sourced Java libraries.

I analyzed the interleaving of some of the concurrency bugs and improve the descriptions.
I modified most of the scripts to support running them on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.
Also, I integrated some external scripts into the Java program.
